AVR Theremin
============

Based on http://www.nerdkits.com/videos/theremin_with_ir_distance_sensor/ with a few modifications.

To build the firmware run `make` in the `software` subdirectory. Flash it to the chip with `make prog`.

The `hardware` subdirectory contains Eagle files for our own PCB design.

Have fun!
